     * Count the number of occurrences of each letter of the alphabet
     * (from 'A' to 'Z') in the given string. The function must return
     * an array containing 26 elements: The item with index 0 contains
     * the number of 'A' in the string, the item with index 1 contains
     * the number of 'B', and so on.
     *
     * This function must be case-insensitive, i.e. the character 'f'
     * must be considered as the same as character 'F'.
     *
     * Characters that are neither in the range 'a' to 'z', nor in the
     * range 'A' to 'Z' must be ignored.
     *
     * The time complexity of your method must be Theta(n),
     * where n is the size of the string.
     *
     * @param s The string of interest.
     * @return An array counting the number of occurrences of each
     * letter.
